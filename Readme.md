# E Commerce Dark Pattern Detector

## Problem Statement

- E-commerce websites often employ deceptive user interface (UI) strategies, commonly known as dark patterns, to influence user behavior in ways that may not be in the user's best interest.

- E-commerce platforms sometimes employ strategies to present products at a seemingly lower price, only to reveal hidden costs during the checkout process.

- Fabricating positive reviews to artificially enhance product ratings and create a false sense of popularity, influencing potential buyers in a misleading manner.

## Objective

Our innovative Chrome extension revolutionizes the fight against deceptive practices on e-commerce websites. Leveraging advanced Machine Learning and intricate algorithms, our solution empowers users to unmask dark patterns and enhance their online shopping experience.
