The smoothness, the camera quality, display and the voice clarity are great. There is way better safety as every app asks to get tracked or not, to send you notifications or you can deny it. The phone in itself is so smooth and it’s so easy to edit videos or reels as no lagging is there.While the experience of switching from android to iOS was great, but there are so many things which are way more complicated in iOS.I can’t use true-caller and have to manually check the number, no headphone jack and airpods are kinda not useful for someone who talks for long hours on cals. (Planning to get the lightning cable wired apple earphones).Also, the fact that it does not have fingerprint is kinda shocking as phones starting from 10k also have that feature now, guess apple should really look in to it.Overall, I feel the pros outweigh the cons.Lastly, the BEST feature is the camera. The crystal clear quality of the camera was one of the reasons why I wanted to get the phone. My father has a Z fold, and personally I like the camera of the iPhone 13 way way better. Could be a personal preference, but I am satisfied.\"\n]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-28T08:41:18.269327Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-28T08:41:18.269801Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-28T08:41:18.282683Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-28T08:41:18.269765Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-28T08:41:18.281197Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from transformers import pipeline\n\ndef split_reviews(reviews, max_words=700):\n    \"\"\"\n    Split a list of reviews into sublists, each containing no more than max_words words.\n    \"\"\"\n    review_arrays = []\n    current_words = 0\n    current_array = []\n\n    for review in reviews:\n        review_length = len(review.split())\n\n        if current_words + review_length > max_words:\n            review_arrays.append(current_array)\n            current_array = []\n            current_words = 0\n\n        current_array.append(review)\n        current_words += review_length\n\n    if current_array:\n        review_arrays.append(current_array)\n\n    review_arrays = [arr for arr in review_arrays if sum(len(review.split()) for review in arr) >= 160]\n\n    return review_arrays\n\ndef summarize_reviews(review_arrays):\n    \"\"\"\n    Summarize each array of reviews using the summarization model.\n    \"\"\"\n    summarizer = pipeline(\"summarization\", model=\"facebook/bart-large-cnn\")\n    summaries = []\n\n    for reviews in review_arrays:\n        article = \" \".join(reviews)\n        summary = summarizer(article, max_length=130, min_length=30, do_sample=False)\n        summaries.append(summary)\n\n    return summaries\n\ndef overall_summary(summaries):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate an overall summary of all the individual summaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    overall_text = \" \".join(summary[0][\"summary_text\"] for summary in summaries)\n    summarizer = pipeline(\"summarization\", model=\"facebook/bart-large-cnn\")\n    overall_summary = summarizer(overall_text, max_length=100, min_length=30, do_sample=False)\n\n    return overall_summary","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-28T08:41:18.284656Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-28T08:41:18.284997Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-28T08:41:18.320437Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-28T08:41:18.284968Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-28T08:41:18.319105Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"review_arrays = split_reviews(reviews)\nsummaries = summarize_reviews(review_arrays)\noverall = overall_summary(summaries)\nfor summary in summaries:\n    print(summary)\nprint(\"Overall Summary:\", overall[0][\"summary_text\"])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-28T08:41:18.323118Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-28T08:41:18.324291Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-28T08:41:56.893062Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-28T08:41:18.324245Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-28T08:41:56.892088Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
